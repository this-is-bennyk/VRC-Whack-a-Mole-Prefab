# VRC Whack-a-Mole Prefab
**By ThisIsBennyK and Sayuyu**  

This is a recreation of the popular arcade game Whack-a-Mole as a prefab for VRChat.

## Features
- Highly customizable: Using the template project, you can stylize the machine and change the game's settings however you'd like! You can even make multiple configurations (ex. 5-hole and 9-hole WAM).
- Multi-instantiable: Place multiple machines in the same world and they'll work independently!
- Synced and secure gameplay: Scores and animations sync up for everyone, and each instance ensures that only one player is playing at a time.
